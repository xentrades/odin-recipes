        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A <strong>casserole</strong> (French: diminutive of casse, from Provençal cassa 'pan'[1]) is a
            kind of large, deep pan or bowl used for cooking a variety of dishes
            in the oven; it is also a category of foods cooked in such a vessel.</p>
            
        <p>To distinguish the two uses, the pan can be called a <strong>"casserole dish" or
            "casserole pan"</strong>, whereas the food is simply "a casserole".
            The same pan is often used both for cooking and for serving.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>2 (10 ounce) cans chunk chicken, drained</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen chopped broccoli</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan; stir in instant rice, cover, and remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix prepared rice, chicken, broccoli, processed cheese, condensed mushroom soup, condensed chicken soup, milk, butter, and onion in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
