        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Shakshuka is the ultimate comfort food that can
            be served for any meal—breakfast, lunch, dinner,
            and even as a snack.</p>
            
        <p>There are many versions—this one has bell peppers,
            onions, tomatoes, and is made in the microwave,
            perfect for when you don’t have access to a stove top or
            don’t want to heat up the kitchen. It’s full of spices,
            like cumin, coriander, and a pinch of cinnamon.</p>
            
        <p>The smells remind us of being in a spice market or
            baking gingerbread, so warm and comforting!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 small red bell peppers, thinly sliced (about 3 cups)</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>2 clove garlic, grated with a Microplane</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon, plus pinch kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place the bell peppers, onions, and 1/4 cup water in a 9 1/2-inch
                deep-dish microwave-safe glass pie plate. Cover tightly with plastic
                wrap and microwave on high until the vegetables are tender-crisp,
                about 8 minutes, stirring once halfway through and re-covering with plastic wrap. 

                Carefully hold the bell pepper mixture back with a spatula or
                slotted spoon and pour out water into the sink.</li>

            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, paprika, =
                ground cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and 3/4
                teaspoon of the salt to drained bell pepper mixture.</li>

            <li>Cover tightly with plastic wrap (you can reuse the same one or
                if you prefer, use a large plate) and use the tip of a paring
                knife to poke a small hole in the center of the plastic wrap to let steam escape. 

                Microwave on high until the sauce is bubbly and hot, about 8 minutes.</li>

            <li>Use the back of a large spoon to make 4 deep wells in the tomato mixture.
                Crack 1 egg into each well. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave
                on high until the egg whites are just set but the yolks remain runny,
                about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. 

                We developed and tested the recipe in a 1,000 and 1,250-watt microwave.
                You may need to cook the eggs for longer, in 30-second intervals, depending
                on the power of your microwave. Look for visual cues: if whites look
                undercooked, keep cooking them until they are just set and yolks are runny.
                
                Season the eggs with a pinch of salt and drizzle with additional olive oil.
                Garnish with cilantro and serve.</li>
            </ol>
